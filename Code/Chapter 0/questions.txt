1)
Do you know the differences between a bitstring, a binary and a charlist ?
How do you write them in Elixir ?
In Erlang ?
A bitstring is a contiguous sequence of bits in memory. Written <<>> in Elixir and in Erlang too.
A binary is a bitstring where the number of bits is divisible by 8. Written <<>> in Elixir and in Erlang too can be checked using the is_binary() function.
A charlist is a list of integers where all the integers are valid code points. Written '' in Elixir and in Erlang too.

2)
What is the main difference between a Stream and an Enum ?
The difference between them is that Enum is eager while Stream is lazy. Enum, being eager, produces a whole list of numbers after each operation in the script until the result is reached. Conversely, Stream, being lazy, creates a stream that represents a function without executing it straight away.

3)
Sort this data structures from the cheapest to the most expensive one in terms of number of operations and CPU time:

    1- Bitstring

    2- Charlist

    3- List
